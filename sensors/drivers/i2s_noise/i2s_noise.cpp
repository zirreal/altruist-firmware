  LoRa Soundkit
  Measures environtmentalsound and send data to LoRa network

  Author Marcel Meek
  Date 12/7/2020
  changed 18-3-2024
  - Sources adapted for LilyGO TTGO T3 LoRa32 board (10dB better radio performance)
  - Sources adapted for VC PlatformIO (arduino IDE support not tested)
  - During a TTN connect phase, the I2S MEMS driver is stopped, because it gives Rx radio interference
  - The update of the OLED display is moved from the sound thread to the main thread.
  changed 15-8-2021
  - MCCI Catena LoRa stack
  - Worker loop changed (hang situation solved with TTN V3)
  - OLED display added
  - DEVEUI obtained from BoardID, (same SW for multiple sensors)
  - use the TWO processor cores of ESP (one core for audio and one core for LoRa)
  - DC offset MEMS compensated by moving average window
  - payload compressed from 27 to 19 bytes
  Changed 1/11/2023
  - Joining TTN problems solved, join was disturbed by I2S driver, it is stopped during join
  - Working loop improved, sleep is postponed after send, and a shorter sleep during joining phase 
  - TTN SF9 is the default and ADR is enabled
